Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================
This file describes how the run_analysis.R script works.

The code uses dplyr; please ensure the dplyr package is installed and loaded.

* First, unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder "data".
* Make sure the folder "data" and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory.
* Second, use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio.
